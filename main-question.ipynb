    "(This exam task is based on an unpublished work by Adam Alami, Raul Pardo, Marisa Leavitt Cohn, and Andrzej Wasowski.  Some early background for the study is published in: Alami, Adam, Marisa Leavitt Cohn, and Andrzej Wasowski. *How Do FOSS Communities Decide to Accept Pull Requests?* (EASE'20). However, we do not expect you to read this study to solve the task.  The background study contains **no quantitative data**. This is also why we do not include it with this exam.  The reference is provided purely for completeness, if you were interested in the subject matter itself, not in the exam.)\n",

    "In this work, we study how different Free & Open-Source Software (FOSS) communities handle [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) (PRs). It is not very important to know what is a PR to perform this task, but we suspect you know this anyways.  The working hypothesis is that there are three dominant models in which projects handle PRs.  We name this models as _protective_, _equitable_ and _lenient_.  \n",

    "We have prepared a survey on PR handling and collected responses from members of the following FOSS communities: FOSSASIA, Odoo, Linux Kernel, Coala, ROS, Plone, ReactJS, NodeJS, OpenGenus, Mozilla, OpenSUSE, jQuery, and Apache."
